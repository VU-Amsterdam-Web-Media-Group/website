      VU&#8217;s <a href="http://www.networkinstitute.org/">Network Institute</a> has a yearly <a href="http://www.networkinstitute.org/academy-assistants/academy-projects-17/">Academy Assistant programme</a> where small interdisciplinary research projects are funded. Within these projects, Master students from different disciplines are given the opportunity to work on these projects under supervision of VU staff members. As in <a href="http://www.victordeboer.com/ict4d-2/gossa-and-myrthe-in-ghana-part-1/">previous </a><a href="http://www.victordeboer.com/ict4d-2/vus-4th-ict4d-symposium-a-look-back/">years</a>, this year, I also participate as a supervisor in one of these projects, in collaboration with <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/petra-bos">Petra Bos</a> from the Applied Linguistics department. And after having found two enthusiastic students: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-hakman-8313aab1/?ppe=1">Dana Hakman</a> from Information Science and <a href="https://www.tm-town.com/translators/certaal">Cerise Muller</a> from Applied Linguistics, the project has just started.
      Our project &#8220;<strong><a href="http://www.networkinstitute.org/academy-assistants/academy-projects-17/"><b>ABC-Kb: A Knowledge base supporting the Assessment of language impairment in Bilingual Children</b></a></strong>&#8221; is aimed at supporting language therapists by (re-)structuring information about language development for bilingual children. Speech language therapists and clinical linguists face the challenge of diagnosing children as young as possible, also when their home language is not Dutch. Their achievements on standard (Dutch) language tests will not be reliable indicators for a language impairment. If diagnosticians had access to information on the language development in the Home Language of these children, this would be tremendously helpful in the diagnostic process.
      This project aims to develop a knowledge base (KB) collecting relevant information on the specificities of 60 different home languages (normal and atypical language development), and on contrastive analyses of any of these languages with Dutch. To this end, we leverage an existing wiki: <a href="https://meertaligheidentaalstoornissenvu.wikispaces.com"><strong>meertaligheidentaalstoornissenvu.wikispaces.com</strong></a>
