	<![CDATA[
	 OBSERVE explores the use of a recommendation system for audiovisual content displayed in public spaces. Media
	 companies are faced with the challenge of selecting content that is interesting and relevant to passers-by, yet
	 re-usable to screen in different locations. Currently, audiovisual content is often pre-programmed in repetitive
	 loops, ignoring the circumstances and the interests of the users. OBSERVE works on a new approach through 1) the
	 use of high-quality interactive content, for which it aims to develop guidelines and best practices; and 2) the
	 development of a context-sensitive content selection system. The role of the VU within OBSERVE will consist in the
	 design of metadata models to describe context types, audiovisual content, and their relationship, and in assessing
	 the potential of Linked Open Data to support the recommender and/or to enrich the audiovisual content.
